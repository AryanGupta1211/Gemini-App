# AI-Powered UI Application

Welcome to the AI-Powered UI Application! This project showcases the powerful capabilities of modern AI through a versatile and user-friendly interface. Developed with Streamlit and the Google Generative AI module, this app provides four core functionalities:

1. **ChatBot**: Engage in natural and intuitive conversations with our AI-powered chatbot.
2. **Image Captioning**: Upload images to receive accurate and descriptive captions generated by AI.
3. **Text Embedding**: Transform text into meaningful embeddings for various applications such as search, clustering, and recommendation systems.
4. **Ask Me Anything**: Leverage the AI's knowledge base to get answers to a wide range of questions.

## Features

### ChatBot
Our ChatBot feature allows users to interact with an AI that understands and responds to natural language queries. Whether you need help, want to have a casual conversation, or ask specific questions, the ChatBot is here to assist you.

### Image Captioning
Upload any image, and our AI will generate a descriptive caption for it. This feature is useful for understanding the content of images and can be applied in various fields such as content creation, accessibility, and more.

### Text Embedding
Convert text into meaningful vector representations. These embeddings can be used for tasks like similarity search, clustering, and recommendation systems, making it easier to analyze and utilize textual data.

### Ask Me Anything
This feature leverages the AI's extensive knowledge base to answer questions on a wide range of topics. Just type your question, and the AI will provide a well-informed response.
